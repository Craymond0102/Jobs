This progam is a database that consists of a BST of students and faculty members

The known problems are the roll back does not work. I tried to get it to work and it kinda works, but in the end it wasn't working
well enough to keep it in the program. I commented out that part of the program

The other known problem that could occur, is each piece of information that is a string cannot take more then one word.
This is because the deserialization reads in after every space (I didn't know how to not have it be that way).
